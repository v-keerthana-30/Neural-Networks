# Neural-Networks
This focuses on building a classification model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to identify different alphabets from the Alphabets_data.csv dataset.

It Includes:

Data Exploration & Preprocessing: Load the dataset, summarize key features, normalize data, and handle missing values.

Model Implementation: Construct an ANN with at least one hidden layer, split data into training and test sets, and train the model to make predictions.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize performance by experimenting with hyperparameters such as number of hidden layers, neurons, activation functions, and learning rate using methods like grid search or random search.

Evaluation: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, comparing results between default and tuned models.

Insights: Analyze the impact of hyperparameter tuning and discuss improvements in model performance.
